The male had a right shoulder surgical implantation of two large staples into the lateral aspect of greater tubercle of the right humerus and a 32 mm (1 \u00bc\u201d) screw into the anterior border of glenoid fossa of the right scapula. He was missing 10 teeth to include his two upper front teeth and there was evidence of a healed nasal fracture. The cause of death could not be determined; however, based on how the body was found this case is considered a homicide.
